# AV/LV Quoting Platform Documentation

This repository contains formal documentation for a PHP-based quoting application supporting audio-visual (AV) and low-voltage (LV) projects. The solution is constrained to PHP on the backend with HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Bootstrap) on the frontend.

## Document Index
- [`docs/requirements.md`](docs/requirements.md): Detailed functional and non-functional requirements.
- [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md): High-level solution architecture and component overview.
- [`docs/database-schema.md`](docs/database-schema.md): Preliminary MySQL schema design.
- [`docs/user-stories.md`](docs/user-stories.md): Role-based user stories for estimators, sales reps, managers, administrators, and clients.
- [`docs/wireframes.md`](docs/wireframes.md): Textual wireframes describing major user interfaces.
- [`docs/implementation-plan.md`](docs/implementation-plan.md): Phase-based implementation roadmap.

## Next Steps
Use these documents as the basis for detailed design, estimation, and development planning. As the project evolves, update each section to reflect the latest decisions, ensuring all business rules remain configurable within the application.
